This project analyzes Montogomery Count, MD alcohol sales data (June 2017 - Sept 2020) to identify patterns in warehouse vs reatil sales. In this case, "sale" means "cases", not dollar amounts. This was done entirely in Excel, including standardizing columns names, addressing duplicates, finding potentially problematic values. 

## Key Findings Include:
* Warehouse Sales dominate for beer and win (bulk purchases by restaurants, bars, sporting events, etc).
* Retail sales/transfers are higher for liquor products.
* Negative warehouse sales for dunnage (empty kegs) and ref (credit items) likely indicates reimbursements for damaged goods.
* Any strong and consistent seasonality patterns are unclear due to data gaps.

Future work would include getting more recent data, retrieving data from every month, investigating any negative sales, etc.

This methodology is adaptable beyond the alcohol industry and open the door for broader inventory optimization and supplier strategy analysis.
